// Create the EmployeeService with two methods:
// getOne: (id: number): Promise<{id: number, firstName: string, lastName: string}>  // delay of 1 sec.
// update: (employee: {id: number, firstName: string, lastName: string}): Promise<{id: number, firstName: string, lastName: string}> // delay of 1 sec.


// Create the EmployeeCtrl which
// initializes the form with the values coming from EmployeeService.getOne (let us assume id = 1234)
// on form submission call the EmployeeService.update and print eventually the changed employee object to the console
